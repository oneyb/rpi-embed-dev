* The Raspberry Pi as a tool for embedded development

This repository contains my ansible playbooks and Home Assistant
configuration. I use the RPi to both compile and upload firmware to
microcontrollers with Platformio, but also a MySensors gateway to receive
sensor data. These playbooks document my configuration of the RPi for these
purposes. In case something breaks I can be up and running quickly.

*Ansible 2.4 or greater is required.*

* Examples

** Quick install of the MySensors gateway for a RPi (running Hassbian)
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ansible-playbook -i hassbian.local, -u pi install-mysensors-gateway-raspberry.yaml
#+END_SRC

** Quick install of Platformio
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ansible-playbook -i raspberrypi.local, -u pi install-platformio.yaml
#+END_SRC

** Setup and Maintenance of Hassbian/Home Assistant
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ansible-playbook -i hassbian.local, -u pi configure-ha-rpi.yaml
#+END_SRC
